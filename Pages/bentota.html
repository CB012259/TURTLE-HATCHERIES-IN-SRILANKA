            We actively rescue and rehabilitate sea turtles at the Bentota Turtle Hatchery. Our committed team works relentlessly to protect turtle eggs and monitor nesting locations throughout the beaches. We carefully gather the eggs and incubate them in a secure and regulated setting. We foster the hatchlings until they are strong enough to be released into the water. We hope that our efforts will give these turtles a fighting shot in their difficult life journey.

            At the Bentota Turtle Hatchery, education is a critical component of our mission. For guests of all ages, we provide educational programs and interactive activities. Our expert crew discusses various turtle species, their life cycles, and the problems they confront in the wild. Visitors can observe the hatching process, help release hatchlings, and learn about the importance of conservation efforts. We inspire people to become environmental stewards and safeguard these wonderful creatures for future generations by raising awareness and knowledge.For our conservation efforts to be successful, community engagement is crucial.

            We regularly work with local people to raise awareness about the need of sea turtle conservation. We also collaborate with fishermen to develop sustainable fishing practices that minimize turtle harm. Additionally, we work to establish ecologically friendly and sustainable methods inside our hatchery in order to lessen the influence we have on the environment.
