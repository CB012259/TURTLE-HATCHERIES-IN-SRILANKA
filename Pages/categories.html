                  <h3>OLIVE RIDELY</h3><br>
                   <p>
                    The Olive Ridley Turtle  (Lepidochelys olivacea) is a small and widespread species of sea turtle found in Sri Lankan coastal waters. It has a heart-shaped carapace with a grayish to olive-green coloration. It has a distinctive head with a slight hooked beak. During the nesting season, the turtles display a synchronized mass event known as an arribada, in which multiple females, sometimes hundreds or even thousands, arrive at the shore at the same time. Nesting sites in Sri Lanka, including Rekawa and Kosgoda, as well as Pottuvil and Panama, are essential for the survival of this species. The Olive Ridley Turtle is omnivorous and feeds on a variety of invertebrates, including jellyfish, shrimps, crabs, and marine urchins. It is an important part of the marine ecosystem and is a sight to behold during the nesting season.

                      <p>The Leatherback Turtle  (Dermochelys coriacea) can be seen in the coastal waters of Sri Lanka. Its unusual leather carapace, rather of a hard shell, makes it the biggest turtle in the world. This species is widely migratory and may be found on a number of beaches that are suitable for breeding, including Pigeon Island and Trincomalee. It has a smooth body with ridges running the length of its carapace. These turtles are vital to the wellbeing of the marine ecology and largely eat jellyfish. Conservation efforts are being made to safeguard their nesting locations and spread awareness of their endangered status.</p>
