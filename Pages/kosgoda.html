              Welcome to Sri Lanka's Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery! Our hatchery is committed to preserving and protecting endangered sea turtles. We work hard to save turtle eggs, provide a safe environment for incubation, and release hatchlings back into the ocean. By visiting our hatchery, you join us in our goal to protect these amazing species and their habitats.

            At the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery, we are actively involved in sea turtle rescue and rehabilitation. Our hardworking team searches for and protects fragile turtle nests on beaches. We carefully gather the eggs and transport them to our hatchery, where they are cared after until they hatch. In addition, we provide medical care and rehabilitation for injured turtles, assisting them in recovering and eventually returning to their natural habitats.

            Education is critical to sea turtle conservation. We provide educational events for guests of all ages at our hatchery. Our skilled guides offer unique insights into sea turtle life cycles, behaviors, and ecological significance. You can view the hatching process, dig nests, and even join nocturnal beach patrols to observe nesting turtles. These projects raise awareness and motivate people to take action to conserve these lovely creatures.

          <p>Community participation is critical to the long-term viability of sea turtle conservation. We work with local communities to raise awareness about the need of safeguarding sea turtles and their ecosystems. We work with fishermen to promote responsible fishing practices that prevent turtle capture. Furthermore, we strive towards sustainable tourist practices, ensuring that our operations have a low environmental impact.</p>
           <p> Join with us to the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery to learn, contribute, and help ensure the future of these ancient sea creatures. We can safeguard and preserve the amazing sea turtles for future generations to enjoy
